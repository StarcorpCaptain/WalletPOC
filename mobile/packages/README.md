## Packages

This acts as a Container for Packages that are still in Progress and will be used in the mobile project.
The reason is to save the trouble of bumping package versions with every change and forcing 'npm i'.

As soon as packages have reached a certain level of maturity they will be published to npm and moved into their own repository or into the global packages folder
